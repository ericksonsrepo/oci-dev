[OCI Overview Lab](https://github.com/dankingsley001/oci-dev/tree/master/OCI_Overview_HOL)
This lab will introduce you to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service.  We will be creating a virtual cloud network, compute instances, and block storage.  Then we will install and configure Docker containers on the compute instance.   This lab is designed to be a simple introduction to many of the services you will use in the design of a customer solution and to familiarize you with those services.
